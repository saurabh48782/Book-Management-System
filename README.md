# Book-Management-System
**A python project to automate tasks in a library or an online book store.**

**Objective:**
This project was done with a vision to enhance  my understanding and knowledge in Python programming language.
Using this project we can understand the working in a Library or an Online Book Store and automate tasks that are there.

**Tech Stacks used in making the project are - Python and SQL.**
For making GUI of the project I've used Tkinter and SQLite is used for handling the databse in the backend part.

**FBMS\BMS.py** is the main python file which contains the source code from where we can run the project. It is the landing page of the project.

**FBMS\login.db** is a database file which stores account and login credentials of the users. Its content can be seen using any database browser, I used DB Browser for SQLite (download link-https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

**FBMS\pages** folder contains several .py files which shows several sections of the Library Management System.

I enjoyed the process of making a GUI in using Python and connecting it with a database.
The project is just a prototype and I welcome your wonderful suggestions which can help to improve it.
